## Hello World!

Welcome to the official documentation for Alive, a multi-chain decentralized live streaming protocol using HLS (HTTP Live Streaming), the video streaming communications protocol that is currently widely used by many websites to deliver video content.

Alive uses IPFS and Skynet as backend storage for HLS stream content and GunDB P2P database as an off-chain streams caching layer and live chat. It is interoperable with Hive and Avalon networks as an immutable store for live video streams and live chat archive, It has been designed such that it can be integrated by any video DApp that wishes to incorporate decentralized live streams with ease.

## Why Alive?

1. **Choices**

    Alive uses two leading decentralized file sharing protocols which are IPFS and Skynet, which enables streamers to select their favourite protocol to push their streams to. They also choose their preferred network and DApp to broadcast their streams to.

2. **Horizontally Scalable**

    Alive is built on multiple blockchain networks, hence the scalability and uptime of Alive is not limited to a single blockchain. Your streams are also spread out across multiple IPFS and Sia (Skynet) nodes to ensure the best live playback performance possible.

3. **Censorship resistance**

    Neither the creator of Alive nor the developers of any P2P protocols used to build Alive can prevent anyone from streaming content through Alive. You own the private keys that enables you to publish .ts hashes of your stream. Your streams are viewable through any Alive-enabled API node which can be run by anyone (including yourself).

## Roadmap

Everything you need to know about the development of Alive can be viewed through the project board [here](https://github.com/orgs/aliveprotocol/projects/1).
