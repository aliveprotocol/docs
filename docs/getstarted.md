You can stream through Alive Protocol using CLI during the testing phrase as the UI for streamers is currently being developed. If you wish to perticipate in the early testing, please contact `techcoderx#7481` on Discord for further information.

The general procedure of creating a stream are as follows:

1. Setup a Hive/Avalon development testnet.
2. If using Hive testnet, setup HAlive and connect to your local testnet in config.
3. Setup Alive-CLI and install AliveDB.
4. Setup an IPFS node.
5. Start Alive daemon.
6. Setup OBS to record HLS to `~/.alive/record_here` and start recording.
