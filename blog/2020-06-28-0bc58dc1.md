Today's video we will be looking into the possibility of adding decentralized HLS live streams to DTube chain, using IPFS or Skynet as file storage backends. Inspired by (and forked from) SkyLive, each HLS chunks are uploaded to IPFS/Skynet, obtaining its hash (or Skylink) which is then broadcasted to Avalon every 10 seconds.
