This is a short demo of the live chat that will be used in Alive streams, a decentralized live streaming protocol on Hive and Avalon, using IPFS and Skynet as storage backend and GunDB for off-chain caching.

Thanks to GunDB, the live chat runs directly on browsers as well as AliveDB peers (which is built into HAlive API and in the future, Avalon nodes) without using a centralized server. Anyone with an Avalon, Hive or Steem account can sign messages and participate. It also includes a simple moderation system where streamers (and approved mods) can approve or blacklist certain users in the chat.
